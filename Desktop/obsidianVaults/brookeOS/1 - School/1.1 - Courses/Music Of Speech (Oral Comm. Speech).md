## Oral Communication Speech

Recently, I’ve had a few particularly fascinating conversations with some amazing jazz performers up in Julliard. In these conversations we discussed the impact that music has on emotion. Music is one of the most powerful state changers that exist in the world today, because the way we use it within a certain situation can induce totally different emotions even on the  sane song. For example, we can use a funny song while we’re playing with our friends as it creates a warmer atmosphere, making this moment feel important in a strange way. However, if we use that same song in a dramatic death scene in a movie, it’ll create this dissonance between what we’re seeing (someone’s death) and what we’re hearing (a song about toilets or what have you), thus treating the death as less impactful and more like a scene from Seinfeld. Music manipulates our feelings by creating a powerful sonic atmosphere around us. There are even certain songs, specifically, that can inspire us… even without words.

In terms of notes,  some would suggest that major notes are more upbeat while minor notes are more melancholy in nature. While I myself don't subscribe to that definition (I believe that notes by themselves don't produce the emotions but instead produce tonal brightness, with major notes being brighter while minor notes being darker), we cannot really deny that the melodies and harmonies made with them can tell their own journey, sometimes even outshining the lyrics themselves. What I find most fascinating however is how closely related the rhythm of a song is to the timing of a speech. 

An inspirational speech has a particular rhythm that helps make it inspirational. The qualities that it possesses are far more than an intelligent selection of words: The way the words are spoken, The timing, The tempo and how it changes, All of these little factors contribute to the huge orchestra of speech and communication. When you listen to a song (especially Rock songs), the perceived speed of the song will change depending on its section, oftentimes without changing the base tempo at all. The beat of the song tends to directly affect the person’s heart. In a speech the same is true. And the beat of a speech lies in the way a person delivers the words as well as how the words are sequenced and punctuated.

For example, as you read a book, the punctuations will help guide your breathing (even if you’re reading it in your head). You will tend to breathe at the end of each paragraph and often at the end of a sentence. If I shorten the sentences, your breathing will speed up, which will in turn impact your heartbeat as well. If you look at a great horror novel you will notice at the most exciting times that the sentences become shorter and shorter. This helps the author produce an emotional reaction in the audience.

In speaking, when we are communicating at a certain rhythm, the audience starts to match us and breathe when we breathe. What this means is that, as we get more and more excited, they will often follow. So, we can impact other people’s emotions by going first ourselves.

The music of a speech lies in understanding that our speaking can be organised into the beats of when we pause, talk and breathe. The more that you realize this, the more you can see that speech writing and delivery is about so much more than the content. It is about the process of how you impact the people you talk to.

To end of this show, I would like to play you all a little piece that a friend of mine wrote. It's called "A World On Fire" by Bo Burnham. (Scream incoherently)
