## TUI Ideas
Lately I've been thinking of creating new programs with [[TUI]] for my [[Linux]] Desktop. It's probably because of my rediscovered love for programming and all things tech (thank you Linus for bringing that fire back to my soul)

Planning that during my semester break, I would at least code a TUI program since I've always loved them, I would turn [[Obsidian]] into a TUI, but like that would sorta ruin the whole writer vibe...

Eh whatever, if I want to feel like a hacker man, gosh darn it then I will be one!

1. TUI for my "Translate" [[Bash]] script
2. TUI Font Manager
3. TUI WiFi and launcher similar to Omarchy
4. An actually good Spotify CLI launcher

I think that [[TUI Font Manager]] would be a great starting point, I've always hated how literally no one made a font manager and everyone just tells you to "put the fonts in the appropriate folder". It gets really tedious and tiring after like the 3rd time... quite literally why I went down this whole bash rabbit hole in the first place.

Listed in the *references* tab are going to be the guides that will hopefully get me in the right track. From the looks of it, I might need to learn C/C++ but I mean... maybe there's a Python library?
