## Workflow Ideas
I've been getting into writing a ton of bash scripts lately. It's hard and I definitely need to a guide on how to actually code in this language but I am getting the hang of things, I think?

This serves as a place where I reflect on my current workflow and think: what can I shave off? 

1. dotoolsd for faster dotools (macros)
2. ms teams... I dont know but ms teams
3. erm...
4. Automatic Chezmoi (or replace chezmoi?) updating and pushing

okay I cant really think of anything now, but I think that I might have more problems in the future.
